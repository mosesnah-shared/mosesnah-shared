### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my Github repo! My name is [**Moses**](https://mosesnah-shared.github.io/). 

I'm a current **Ph.D candidate at [MIT MECHE](https://github.com/mosesnah-shared)**, working at the [**MIT Newman Lab**](https://newmanlab.mit.edu/) under [**Prof. Neville Hogan**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P7S5TY0AAAAJ&hl=en)

**Fascinated by Robotics at my early 20s via the two books** written by [**Norbert Wiener**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) - [**Cybernetics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine) and [**The Human Use of Human Beings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Use_of_Human_Beings), 
I promised myself to be a Roboticist. One of Wiener's piercing insight which broadened my perspective was the claim that **humans and robots are fundamentally the same as information-processing entities.**

I simply *love* **Math and Physics**. In case you if are interested, check out **some of my notes [here](https://mosesnah-shared.github.io/notes_index.html)**. 
I also do a lot of coding, and you can check all my codes here! Enjoy :grin:
